Script for project entitled *Environmental Factors Influencing Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer Incidence: Integrating Chemical Signatures from Dust Wipes with Self-Reported Sources of Exposure*.


**Abstract:**  
Breast cancer is a highly prevalent disease with increasing risk attributable to chemical exposures, though most chemicals to which humans are exposed remain understudied in breast cancer research. This study tested the hypothesis that environmental chemicals present in households of women with and without breast cancer will have differential abundance, and that chemical profiles relate to self-reported sources of exposures. Household dust wipe samples were collected at the time of enrollment for participants in the Sister Study cohort and were analyzed using non-targeted approaches. The subsample analyzed included 40 women who developed hormone receptor positive breast cancer after sample collection (cases), and 40 women who remained breast cancer free through a follow-up period (controls). Samples were analyzed via liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) coupled with database mining approaches. Participant survey data included personal care product usage and information on proximity to environmental pollution sources. Frequent itemset mining (FIM) was used to understand chemical occurrence and associations with survey data. Analyses yielded 189 features annotated to potential chemicals that significantly differed (adjusted p<0.1) in abundance between samples collected from the cases and controls. Example chemicals included suspected endocrine disruptors 23-(Nonylphenoxy)-3,6,9,12,15,18,21-heptaoxatricosan-1-ol, triethanolamine, and thiabendazole. Analysis of survey data identified a chemical of high interest due to its link derived through FIM to 45 exposure scenarios, largely described by elevated personal care product usage habits. Overall, this study builds the evidence base for understudied chemicals in everyday household environments that may alter breast cancer risk.

**Experiment_1-** Imputation of dust wipe missing NTA data using the GSimp algorithm.

**Experiment_2-** Priortization of molecular features from the imputed dust wipe NTA dataset for annotation through MS2 and assessment of demographic characteristics of the cohort of women providing samples for this analysis.

**Experiemnt_3-** Logistic regression of annotated chemical features to evaluate the association between dust wipe abundance and breast cancer case status.

**Experiment_4-** Frequent Itemset Mining to link self-reported environmental exposures with dust wipe abundance of annotated chemical substances.
